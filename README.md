Cloning -Cosmetics, Beauty Products, Fragrances &amp; Tools | Sephora
This is my first ever individual project. I was very excited to reveal this.
Firstly as an individual person, I would like to express how grateful I am to Masai School for giving me this wonderful opportunity to learn under their guidance and for sharing my project experience which I had done remotely.
Some snapshots of our cloned website…
Introduction
my task was to implement my HTML, CSS, and Advanced JavaScript knowledge which I had learned at Masai. I used this skillset to build a static copy of the Sephora clone along with the responsiveness of the page for different screen sizes and some user interactivity with Advanced JS.
How we started the project
Firstly I noted all the difficulties I might face in the project and worked on it initially like fetching data from the database. Then I divided the work equally and constantly discussed the progress and complimented each of my work and kept moving forward until I reached the goal. I worked hard to find the solutions for the difficulties I was facing while doing the project. I enjoyed with project's progress.
Roles and responsibilities of Myself
I got a full week to build this clone website. and I was very happy to build this clone. when I start to build this clone many things went wrong later I have invested lots of time and in the end, I got a good result. I was very happy to see that, the impact I got lots of appreciation from my friend's circle.
The platform used for communication
Delivering a result-oriented output of any work/project communication between the people when I got stuck is the most crucial part. I used slack and zoom to communicate with each other. For borrowing one's code I used git hub.
Challenges
Fetching the data from API.
Creating own database for fetching data.

Takeaways
To be able to work on a project an individual member must possess leadership qualities, he should be able to contribute ideas and be respectful with himself.
I thoroughly enjoyed the project and looking forward to future projects.
